# NuPay for Java

This is a basic Java wrapper for [Nubank's NuPay API](https://docs.nupaybusiness.com.br/#/checkout/). It is still under development, some features may not be implemented yet.

> **Important:** I haven't had the opportunity to test it in production yet, not even in Sandbox. It is highly unstable until then. **Don't use it in production yet.**
